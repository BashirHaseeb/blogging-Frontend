# Introduction to C++

**C++** is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for developing applications, games, and system software. As an extension of C, it introduces object-oriented programming, making it versatile and efficient.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of **C++ programming** to help you get started on your coding journey.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To begin programming in C++, you'll need:
1. A **C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang).
2. An IDE (e.g., **Visual Studio**, **Code::Blocks**, or **VS Code**) for writing and managing your code.

### Installation Steps:
- For Windows: Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- For macOS/Linux: Use the terminal to install GCC via your package manager.

## Writing Your First Program

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Library for input and output

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Print to console
    return 0;
}
```

## Control Structures in C++
Control structures allow you to define the flow of your program. Common control structures in C++ include:

Conditional Statements
if Statement:

```cpp
int num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    std::cout << "The number is greater than 5." << std::endl;
}

```
if-else statement:

```cpp
int num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    std::cout << "The number is greater than 5." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "The number is 5 or less." << std::endl;
}
```
switch statement:
```cpp
int choice = 2;
switch (choice) {
    case 1:
        std::cout << "Choice is 1." << std::endl;
        break;
    case 2:
        std::cout << "Choice is 2." << std::endl;
        break;
    default:
        std::cout << "Invalid choice." << std::endl;
}

```
## Loops

for Loop:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << "Iteration: " << i << std::endl;
}
```

while loop:
```cpp
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    std::cout << "Count: " << count << std::endl;
    count++;
}
```

do-while Loop:
```cpp
int count = 0;
do {
    std::cout << "Count: " << count << std::endl;
    count++;
} while (count < 5);

```

## Functions in C++
Functions allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks. A function in C++ consists of:

- A return type (e.g., int, void).
- A function name.
- A parameter list (optional).
- A body enclosed in {}.
- **Example: A Simple Function**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to add two numbers
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = addNumbers(5, 10);
    std::cout << "The sum is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Function with No Return Value (void)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to print a message
void printMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello from the function!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printMessage();
    return 0;
}
```

## Summary
In this tutorial, you learned the basics of C++ programming, including:

- Setting up your environment.
- Writing your first program.
- Using control structures for decision-making and loops.
- Creating and using functions.
By mastering these fundamentals, you'll be well on your way to writing efficient and powerful C++ programs. Happy coding!
